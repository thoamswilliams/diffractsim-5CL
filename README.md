# 5CL Capstone Project: Simulation of Diffraction Patterns

This repo includes a fork of DiffractSim (https://zenodo.org/records/6147772) and our implementation of (https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.399011) for inverse design of diffraction masks.

To run DiffractSim, install dependencies from requirements.txt and refer to startupTest.py.

To run inverse design, first run generate_LRDS.py, and then run DIA_inverse.py.

The images used in our experiments and the final report can be found on report_images.py.
